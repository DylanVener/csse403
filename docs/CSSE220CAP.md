# COURSE ASSESSMENT PLAN

APPROVED:

## INSTRUCTOR

Michael Hewner (2 sections)
Joe Hollingsworth (2 sections)
...and more

# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PREVIOUS OFFERING AND CORRESPONDING CHANGES

* Continue revisions to the OO-curriculum, try to reduce student
  frustration with UML
* Implement the threading piloting officially

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

Students who successfully complete this course should be able to:

1. Develop software that incorporates the following techniques:
   - Inheritance and class hierarchies
   - Interfaces
   - Polymorphism
   - Casting
   - Exceptions
   - Collections
   - Event-driven graphical user interfaces
   - Exploring and using large-scale API packages such as Java's Swing
   - Recursion
2. Perform the following steps of the software development cycle effectively:
   - Design expressed as UML class diagrams
   - Documentation before coding
   - Unit and system testing
3. Explain the implementation of linked lists
4. Analyze the asymptotic worst case run time of simple programs.
5. Predict the performance of simple algorithms, including search and
   sort, given their asymptotic worst, best, and average case run
   times.  
6. Select basic data structures (i.e., arrays, linked lists, and hash
   maps) based on asymptotic time complexity of typical operations.
7. Work in a team of 3-4 students on a small-to-medium-size software
   development project including at least three iterative development
   cycles, demonstrating effective:
   - Use of team roles
   - Team decision making
   - Division of labor
   - Conflict resolution
8. Explain what a thread is, why one wants to use them, and what can
   go wrong.
   
# MAPPING TO DEPARTMENT STUDENT OUTCOMES

Outcome 1 (insofar as it lays the foundation for object-oriented
design and development) contributes to the following outcomes:

* Effectively apply a variety of computing resources, programming
  languages, programming paradigms, operating systems, networks, and
  software development tools (CS, ICS)

* Apply software engineering theory, principles, tools and processes,
  as well as the theory and principles of computer science and
  mathematics, to the full lifecycle of complex, scalable software
  systems (SE)


# DESCRIPTION OF ASSESSMENT TOOLS 

Written exercises and small programs: Short thought problems,
mathematical analyses, or design exercises.  Students are also asked
to implement a few of the designs.  Written evaluations of team
members.

Programming assignments: Several programming assignments of varying
size and length.

Exams: 2 exams during the term, plus the final exam

Project: A small-to-medium-size software development project including
at least three iterative development cycles done by teams of 3 or 4
students

# SUCCESS CRITERIA

The course will be considered fully successful if the following
statement holds for every tool-outcome pair selected above:

Among the students who earn proficient grades in the course, the
average grade on the portions of the assessment tools that are
relevant to the learning outcome is in the proficient range.
