CSSE 403 — Programming Language Paradigms

# COURSE ASSESSMENT PLAN

APPROVED:

## INSTRUCTOR

Michael Hewner (1 sections)

# RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PREVIOUS OFFERING AND CORRESPONDING CHANGES

* Attempt to develop Rust & Haskell (might take more than 1 term, depending)
* Add some additional lectures on deeper topics

This year we're teaching 403 as an overload, so we're going to have to
keep development of new materials to a miniumum.  I'll try to make
perhaps 1 new full lecture in each of the main languages.

# LEARNING OUTCOMES

Students who successfully complete this course should be able to:

Write programs in a variety of programming language paradigms (such as
statically type-safe functional languages, object-based languages, or
process-oriented languages) using the features unique to those
paradigms.

Identify the semantic similarities and differences between a new
programming language and previously known languages.  Clearly explain
the key semantic features of a new programming language, including how
to begin using it and its strengths and weakness.

Develop medium-sized applications in a new programming language
through independent study.  (Here "medium-sized" implies a project
that a team of three might develop over a period of seven weeks in
parallel with other course work.)

# DESCRIPTION OF ASSESSMENT TOOLS 

In-class exercises: In-class programming exercises

Homework assignments: Regular assignments involving solving simple
programming problems using a restricted subset of a programming
language along with short reflective essays

Team project: A medium-sized software development project conducted by
a team of three students in a language unique to each team.

In-class teaching experience: a 25–50 minute teaching experience in
which a team introduces a new programming language to their
classmates, helps them write a simple program in the language, and
demonstrates the team’s term project

# SUCCESS CRITERIA

The course will be considered fully successful if the following
statement holds for every tool-outcome pair selected above:

Among the students who earn proficient grades in the course, the
average grade on the portions of the assessment tools that are
relevant to the learning outcome is in the proficient range.

# REVISIONS

* 7/15/18 CAP for next year
* 8/12/16 CAP for next year
* 7/11/16 Michael Hewner: New version taught by me, keeping pretty much to the same outcomes (although some of the languages have changed)
* 8/18/2010, Curt Clifton: Relaxed the restriction on the in-class teaching experience assessment tool to allow for ½ period presentations.
* 8/13/2009, Curt Clifton: This is the first offering of the course under a non-experimental course number.  Previous documents are in the repository under CSSE490. Combined teaching experience and project demonstration assessment tools into a single tool, as recommended in previous Assessment Report.
