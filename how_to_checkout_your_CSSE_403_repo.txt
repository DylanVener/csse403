HOW TO CHECK OUT YOUR CSSE 403 REPO

So we'll be submitting most of our assignments via SVN, as you used in
your CSSE120/220/230 classes.  But this time we won't have eclipse to
manage the process.  You'll want to use svn on the command line this
time.  If you're using unix, this is usually as simple ass installing
a package called "subversion" - google it.

Also, you need to figure out your year code.  Your year code is the
year of the later part of the academic term (so if it is the 2014-2015
term, the year is 2015) followed by either 10 (fall) 20 (winter) or 30
(spring).

Once you know that, your repo url should be:
http://svn.csse.rose-hulman.edu/repos/csse403-YEARCODE-YOURNETID

So for example, if I was taking this course in Winter 2014-2015, my
url would be:

http://svn.csse.rose-hulman.edu/repos/csse403-201520-hewner

Once I have the URL, I can check out my SVN repo like this:

svn co http://svn.csse.rose-hulman.edu/repos/csse403-201520-hewner

Use svn commit to make changes to your repo.
Use svn update to get new homework assignments when they're released.

If you're not sure how to use svn, try asking a friend or online
tutorial.  But I'm always available as a backup if that doesn't work
:D.

You'll need to use your svn password to check it out.  If you need
it reset, use this form:

https://svn.csse.rose-hulman.edu/password/

You will login with your usual rose password, and then can set your SVN password to whatever you like.
